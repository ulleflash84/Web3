"Not Your Bro is a metaverse movement focused on empowerment and celebration of all Womxn & LGBTQIA+ people.

At the centre of our movement is a powerful 10,000 piece NFT collection, filled with the colours of the rainbow and depicting a figure of inspiration to our artist, Natalie.

Weâ€™re here to make a difference and harness the power of NFTs for good."
