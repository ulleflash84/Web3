Beautiful unique women taking time for their mental wellness.

Each of the women is performing a remedy-ritual that makes herself feel better, be it enjoying a quality glass of wine, singing her favorite song or buying herself some flowers.â€‹
The outfit, background and remedy combination of each and every woman are styled attentively. All NFTs are unique and aim to represent real-life self-loving ladies.
